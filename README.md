# Linkages in Intra-ASEAN and Extra-ASEAN Trade

**Brief Description and Expected Competencies**

This project is an interactive visualization of the ASEAN bloc's trade structure, detailing two things:

1. The direction and magnitude of intra-ASEAN and extra-ASEAN trade, and 
2. The types of commodities traded inside and outside ASEAN.

This product is tailored for policymakers and academics interested in ASEAN trade. As such, users are expected to understand some concepts related to trade, particularly on the 2-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes utilized in classifying types of merchanidise goods traded.

**Visualization Details**

The chord diagram details the magnitude and direction of trade between ASEAN member-states and their largest trading partners outside ASEAN. Each arc at the outer portion of the diagram correspond with the total value of their exports in millions US$, and the width of the chord by the arc denotes how much exports are directed towards its trading partner. For instance, if the value of exports of country A is $100, and it exports goods worth $10 to country B, then the width of the chord on country A's side would take up the equivalent of $10 in the chord diagram.

Hovering the cursor over the arc highlights bilateral trade relations for which the country is a net exporter. Furthermore, hovering the mouse cursor over the chord displays a tooltip which shows the total value of exports of both countries, and which countries' flows are being highlighted. 

The bar charts showcase the top 5 commodities, marked by their 2-digit HS code, traded within and outside ASEAN. Users may select whether they want to analyze exports, imports, or total trade (exports + imports). 

**Running the project**

To run the project, simply download "*ASEAN Trade Linkages.html*"  and run it with your preferred browser. No other set-ups are required, as the project was constructed via d3.

**Replicating or playing with the project code**

To replicate the project, simply open "*ASEAN Trade Linkages.html*", as this file contains the source code of the app. This group recommends utilizing an app like JSBin when replicating or playing with the code. After opening the file, copy and paste the code to the html editor.
